Experiment Log - Feb 2, 2026

- Prompt: "Write API fetch function"
  - v1: Direct code, no plan → hasty.
  - v2: Added "ALWAYS plan" → outlined steps + risks.
  - v3: Verification added → suggested tests/logs.
- Compared to Cursor sim: Cursor rules with globs more targeted; Copilot global but consistent with emphatic language.
